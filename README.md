# Handedness and Longevity Study

This project analyzes the relationship between handedness (right-handed vs. left-handed) and lifespan using data from a National Geographic Survey conducted in 1986. The study focuses on determining if there is a significant difference in the average age at death between right-handers and left-handers.

## Motivation

The question of whether left-handed people have a shorter lifespan compared to right-handed people has been a topic of interest for centuries. While some studies have suggested that left-handers may have shorter lifespans, others have found no significant differences. This project seeks to explore this relationship further using a large dataset from the 1986 National Geographic Survey.

## Summary of the Study

- **Data Source**: The study uses data from the 1986 National Geographic Survey, which received over a million responses. Participants provided information about their age, sex, and hand preference (for throwing and writing).
  
- **Key Findings**: 
  - The average age at death for right-handers was found to be 72.79 years.
  - The average age at death for left-handers was 67.24 years.
  - This significant age difference suggests that left-handers, on average, may have a shorter lifespan compared to right-handers.

- **Interpretation**: While the results of this study indicate a noticeable age gap, they do not conclusively support the hypothesis that left-handed people have inherently shorter lifespans. It is important to note that this study was conducted using data from 1986. If the same survey were conducted today, we would expect a shifted version of the lifespan distribution due to changes in healthcare, lifestyle, and societal factors over time.

## Insights

This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between handedness and longevity. It suggests that there is a noticeable difference in the average age at death between right-handers and left-handers. However, further research is required to confirm these findings and to explore the underlying factors contributing to any differences in lifespan between the two groups.

## Future Research

- **Updating the Data**: A modern-day replication of this survey could provide updated insights into whether handedness continues to influence longevity in the same way.
- **Investigating Contributing Factors**: Additional studies could focus on identifying other variables (e.g., lifestyle, health conditions, occupational factors) that may contribute to the observed age differences between right-handers and left-handers.

## Conclusion

This project sheds light on the longstanding question regarding the lifespan of left-handed individuals compared to right-handed individuals. While the findings are significant, more comprehensive research is necessary to fully understand the complexities behind the relationship between handedness and longevity.
